- [ ] Team sync on testing progress

### Monthly
- [ ] Update baseline benchmarks
- [ ] Review and refactor tests
- [ ] Update testing strategy
- [ ] Training/knowledge sharing

## Risk Mitigation

### Technical Risks
- [ ] Mock complexity - Use simple, maintainable mocks
- [ ] Test brittleness - Focus on behavior, not implementation
- [ ] Performance impact - Run heavy tests in parallel
- [ ] Flaky tests - Proper async handling and isolation

### Process Risks
- [ ] Slow adoption - Provide training and examples
- [ ] Coverage gaming - Review test quality, not just numbers
- [ ] Maintenance burden - Automate what's possible
- [ ] Integration complexity - Use test containers

## Success Criteria

### Current Reality Check

- **Integration Tests**: ⚠️ NEEDS WORK (58 failing, 76% pass rate)
- **E2E Tests**: 🔄 NOT STARTED
- **CI/CD**: ⚠️ BROKEN (hiding failures with || true)

### Revised Technical Metrics
- Coverage: Currently 87.8% for unit tests ✅
- Integration test pass rate: Target 100% (currently 76%)
- Performance: Adjust thresholds based on reality
- Reliability: Fix flaky tests during repair
- Speed: CI pipeline < 5 minutes ✅ (~2 minutes)

### Team Metrics

## Phases Completed

- **Phase 0**: Immediate Fixes ✅ COMPLETED
- **Phase 1**: Vitest Migration ✅ COMPLETED  
- **Phase 2**: Test Infrastructure ✅ COMPLETED
- **Phase 3**: Unit Tests (All 943 tests) ✅ COMPLETED
- **Phase 3.5**: Critical Service Testing ✅ COMPLETED
- **Phase 3.8**: CI/CD & Infrastructure ✅ COMPLETED
- **Phase 4**: Integration Tests 🚧 IN PROGRESS
  - **Status**: 58 out of 246 tests failing (23.6% failure rate)
  - **CI Issue**: Tests appear green due to `|| true` error suppression
  - **Categories of Failures**:
    - Database: 9 tests (state isolation, FTS5 syntax)
    - MCP Protocol: 16 tests (response structure in error-handling.test.ts)
    - MSW: 6 tests (not initialized properly)
    - FTS5 Search: 7 tests (query syntax issues)
    - Session Management: 5 tests (async cleanup)
    - Performance: 15 tests (threshold mismatches)
  - **Next Steps**: 
    1. Get team buy-in for "red" CI
    2. Remove `|| true` from workflow
    3. Fix tests systematically by category
- **Phase 5**: E2E Tests 🔄 PENDING
